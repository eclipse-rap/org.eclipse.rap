Eclipse RAP Runtime (Remote Application Platform)
=================================================

Thanks for your interest in this project. The [Eclipse RAP Runtime] [1]
provides a powerful widget toolkit and integrates well with proven
technologies such as OSGi and Java EE. You can write your application
entirely in Java, re-use code and benefit from first-class IDE tools.

Git Repository Structure
------------------------

| directory   | content                                                     |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bundles/`  | all bundle projects                                         |
| `tests/`    | unit test projects                                          |
| `features/` | feature projects                                            |
| `releng/`   | projects for release engineering                            |
| `examples/` | for bundles containing exemplary applications and demo code | 

Additional information regarding source code management, builds, coding
standards, and more can be found on the
[Getting involved with RAP development] [2] pages. For more information,
refer to the [RAP wiki pages] [3].

Building RAP Runtime
--------------------

The RAP project uses Tycho with Maven to build its bundles, features,
examples, and p2 repositories, and it's *easy* to run the build locally!
All you need is Maven installed on your computer, and then you need to
run the following command from the root of the Git repository:

    mvn clean verify

As a result, you'll get a p2 repository with all the RAP Runtime bundles and
features in

    releng/org.eclipse.rap.build/repository/target/repository/

and a second one with the RAP e4 Runtime bundles in

    releng/org.eclipse.rap.build/repository.e4/target/repository/

Official builds are available from the [RAP Download page] [4].
