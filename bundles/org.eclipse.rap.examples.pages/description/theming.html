  <h2>Theming</h2>

  <p>
  RAP widgets can be extensively styled to create a custom look &amp; feel.
  This is done using CSS-syntax, so there is no need to touch any Java-code.
  </p>
  <p>
  Theming can influence the layout by adding custom padding, define fonts,
  colors and images used by widgets, and even create rounded borders, gradients
  and animations.
  </p>

  <h3>Animations</h3>
  <p>
  You can see animations in this example in different places:
  <dl>
    <dt>Hover-effect on Buttons</dt>
    <dd>
      The buttons in the second row show an animated hover effect.
    </dd>
    <dt>Sliding Menus</dt>
    <dd>
      Click on the items in the toolbar to see differently styled and animated
      menus.
    </dd>
    <dt>Fading Tooltips</dt>
    <dd>
      Staying over any of the button will fade-in a tool-tip.
    </dd>
    <dt>Fading overlay for modal Shells</dt>
    <dd>
      Clicking the &quot;About&quot;-button in the upper left will open a modal
      dialog with an animated overlay.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  </p>

  <h3>Custom Variants</h3>  
  <p>
  Using <em>custom variants</em>, single widgets can be styled differently from
  others, as demonstrated on this page. A custom variant is a name that can
  be attached to widgets in Java code and referred to in the CSS, just like
  classes in HTML.
