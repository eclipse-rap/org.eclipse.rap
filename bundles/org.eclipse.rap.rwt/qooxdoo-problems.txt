1.) Sometimes Checkbox and Radioboxes do not change their 'checked'-depiction
although the user clicked the component. The event triggered by the user-action
seemed to be fired though. See Window1 online example.

2.) Is there a possibility to fire resize events directly? We currently use
changeHeight and changeWidth for emulation.

3.) The label of a button does not automatically clip in case the size of the
label is bigger than the size of the button's box. The same seems to be the
case for a label widget.

4.) How to properly dispose of widgets? widget.dispose() seems not sufficient.
In case of a shell, it stays visible but unusable, when trying to dispose of
a text field that way nothing happens. Calling hide() before disposing of the
widget seems to work. Is there more to take care of?

5.) What is the difference between qx.ui.tree.Tree and 
qx.ui.treefullcontrol.Tree? ...tree.Tree seems not able to hide the root node,
that's right?

6.) TextArea doesn't accept the wrap attribute

7.) Color settings for table component are static contstants

8.) TreeFullControl sends selection event when expanding/collapsing node.

9.) Disposing of a currently visible toolTip fails with the following errors:
  ERROR: qx.ui.popup.ToolTip[632]: Modification of property "visibility" failed 
  with exception: TypeError - this._hideTimer has no properties
  ERROR: qx.manager.object.ToolTipManager[42]: Modification of property 
  "currentToolTip" failed with exception: TypeError - this._showTimer has 
  no properties

10.) Button overwrites custom backgroundColor and border after mouse over.

11.) Initial positioning of scrollbars (e.g. setScrollLeft) does not work

12.) Creating a table on an invisible tab within a tab folder yields error
  message: 
  Modification of property "maximum" failed with exception: TypeError -
  vCurrentChild has no properties

13.) Some parts of a table are drawn not until the first mouse move.

14.) How to make a qx.ui.form.TextField read-only?

15.) Setting font and/or foreground color is ignored when done in the same
     JavaScript chunk in which the wiget is created

16.) Sometimes, when an empty Text field is focussed and/or blurred using the
     tab key, the getText() method returns the string "null". This is probably
     also a qx problem.

17.) Is there a way to display characters "<" and ">" in the text of a
     qx.ui.basic.Label? As Label accepts HTML input, "&lt;" and "&gt;" should be
     rendered appropriately.

18.) A qx.ui.basic.Atom displaying a wrapped and centered text in its label
     does not align the label properly. It seems that the Boxlayout assumes the
     width of the non-wrapped child.

19.) treefullcontrol causes debug message "Could not load: 
     icon/16/places/folder.png" event though icon and selectedIcon were set
     in TreeRowStructure

20.) What happens with a RadioManager when a Composite with some radio buttons
     gets disposed of? After that radioButton.getMaanger() return null, but
     the RadioManagers' dispose methods seems not to be called.     

21.) Setting the property "icon" on qx.ui.window.Window has no effect. The
     window icon can only be set using the constructor. (Qx Bug 87)

22.) If the property "resizable" is set to false on a qx.ui.window.Window, the
     maximize button is grayed out and the window cannot be maximized even if
     "allowMaximize" is true. (Qx Bug 288)
