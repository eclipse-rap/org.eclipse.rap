# Contributing to Eclipse Remote Application Platform

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The Eclipse Remote Application Platform™ (RAP) is a framework for modular
business applications that can be accessed from different types of clients
including web browsers, rich clients, and mobile devices. It provides a
powerful, multi-platform widget toolkit with SWT API that enables developers to
write applications entirely in Java and re-use the same code on different
platforms. Regardless of the client platform, RAP applications run on a server
that communicates with its clients over HTTP. Applications can therefore be
deployed on any servlet container. With the RAP OSGi integration, they can be
composed of modules and communicate using the OSGi service model.
